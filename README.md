# math-tools
A set of general purpose mathmetical tools
The tools are available both in interactive and direct from environment format. All codes are well commented and easy to understand for beginers.Codes are written in Python 3, C and FORTRAN.
R is coming soon.

**Note:The one with *-ia* are interactive.**

## Quadratic Solver 
The code needs the coefficients of the equation as input.

## Table maker
Able to make table of any polynomial function of single variable. 
Requires the coefficients of the variable in desending order, starting point, ending point and step deviation respectively, as input.
## Wide range trigonometric calculator
A legacy code. It was my first self-made algorithm. Runs well. **Only interactive format available**
